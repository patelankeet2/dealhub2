# ðŸ”’ DealHub Security Audit Report  

**Date:** 10 September 2025  
**Auditor:** Internal (via OWASP Lite Workflow + Manual Review)  
**Scope:** DealHub Web App (Firebase + GitHub Actions CI/CD)  

---

## 1. Methodology  

The audit was conducted using a combination of:  
- **OWASP Top 10 (2021/2025)** as the security baseline.  
- **OWASP Lite GitHub Workflow** (Semgrep + Gitleaks) for automated scanning.  
- **Manual review** of codebase, Firebase configuration, and deployment workflows.  

---

## 2. Findings  

### âœ… Resolved Issues  

**Finding 1 â€“ Hardcoded Firebase API Keys (OWASP A08:2021 â€“ Software and Data Integrity Failures)**  
- **Description:** Firebase API keys were stored directly in `firebaseConfig.js` and committed to GitHub.  
- **Impact:** Could enable misuse of Firebase project if Firestore rules are weak.  
- **Fix Applied:**  
  - Removed hardcoded API keys.  
  - Migrated config to **environment variables** + **GitHub Secrets**.  
  - Updated CI/CD to inject secrets securely.  

**Finding 2 â€“ Missing Automated Security Scanning (OWASP A05:2021 â€“ Security Misconfiguration)**  
- **Description:** No automated scanning existed in CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Impact:** Risk of secrets or unsafe code patterns entering production.  
- **Fix Applied:**  
  - Added **OWASP Lite Workflow** (Semgrep + Gitleaks).  
  - Configured to run on PRs + commits.  
  - Workflow fails if issues are detected.

### ðŸš§ Pending Improvements  

**Finding 3 â€“ Firestore Security Rules (OWASP A01:2021 â€“ Broken Access Control)**  
- **Description:** Current Firestore rules may grant broad access.  
- **Risk:** Unauthorized data exposure or modification.  
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Enforce **least-privilege** (user can only access their own docs).  
  - Add role-based access if required (e.g., admin vs normal user).  

**Finding 4 â€“ Input Validation (OWASP A03:2021 â€“ Injection & A04:2021 â€“ Insecure Design)**  
- **Description:** Limited input validation observed in client/server code.  
- **Risk:** Injection attacks, malformed data stored in Firestore.  
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Add client-side validation (length, type, sanitization).  
  - Add server-side validation before Firestore writes.

## 3. Audit Summary  

| Area                       | Status     | Notes |
|-----------------------------|------------|-------|
| Hardcoded Secrets           | âœ… Fixed   | Migrated to env + GitHub Secrets |
| OWASP Lite Workflow         | âœ… Fixed   | Runs on PRs + commits |
| Firestore Security Rules    | ðŸš§ Pending | Needs least-privilege enforcement |
| Input Validation            | ðŸš§ Pending | Strengthen frontend + backend |
| CI/CD Secret Management     | âœ… Fixed   | Firebase workflows secured |

---

## 4. Next Steps  

1. **Update Firestore rules** with least-privilege access.  
2. **Harden input validation** on client & server.  
3. Add periodic security re-scans (e.g., monthly scheduled OWASP Lite runs).  

---

âœ… **Conclusion:** DealHub security posture is stronger after removing hardcoded secrets and adding automated scans. Remaining tasks: finalize Firestore rules + improve input validation.
