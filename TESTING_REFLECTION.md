# Reflection on Testing and CI

Through this activity, I learned the importance of automated testing in ensuring code reliability and stability. Writing tests with Jest and React Testing Library gave me confidence that key UI elements like navigation links and buttons behave as expected.

Setting up Git Hub Actions for continuous integration means that every commit and pull request is automatically validated, reducing the risk of introducing bugs into production. I also realized how testing helps document the intended behavior of components, making future maintenance easier.

Overall, this task improved my understanding of test-driven development practices and the value of integrating CI pipelines into modern React applications.
